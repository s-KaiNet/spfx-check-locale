# SPFx Check Locale

The extension is automatically activated for your SharePoint Framework solutions and checks, whether all of your localization resource files (`en-us.js`, `nl-nl.js`, etc.) follow the pattern, defined in the corresponding `strings.d.ts` definition. It prevents accidental or refactoring errors in SPFx solutions.

Below short video best describes how it works:

The extension doesn't support configuration.
